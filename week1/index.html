        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In my ongoing quest to decrease the amount of time that I spend doing chores, I recognized the need to be able to perform an activity without spending time moving to where the activity needs to be done. This need serves as the foundation for my final project idea: a robot that can draw using my hand movements as input. Ideally, this will allow me to mime drawing while far away from a chalkboard yet still have my drawings be expressed on the board.</p>
        <h2>Components</h2>
        <p>This project will require two main components: the input device (to be used on one's arm) and the drawing device (to be attatched to a chalkboard).</p>

        <p>In Figure 1, I constructed the input device in blue. While I do not have a specific design for it yet, I believe that it will provide angular data (similar to an arm rotating). From this device, I have constructed dotted lines representing how certain angles will correspond to certain points on the blackboard (red).</p>
        <p>In Figure 2, I drew my working design for the drawing apparatus. While I considered mechanisms that use vertical and horizontal movement, I eventually settled on a design that uses suspension. I chose this design with the hopes that it will more easily navigate curves as opposed to straight lines.</p>
        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <p>In order to finish my project on time, I have split it up into different parts to be completed separately.</p>
